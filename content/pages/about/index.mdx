## What to expect from this blog?
Hello I am Nabheet Madan a technology enthusiast, always willing to learn and share new things. +
As the world of SAP is moving towards Business Technology Platform aka BTP, it gets immensely confusing for 
the customer also to incorporate this move. More than the how to move to BTP, it is very important to 
understand first the WHY. So intent of starting this blog is to simplify and help not only our developer 
but as well as customers in embracing the SAP BTP journey. We will be taking this journey starting From **WHY->WHAT WE CAN DO->HOW**
